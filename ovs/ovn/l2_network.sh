# While OVN is generally focused on the implementation of logical networks using
# overlays, it’s also possible to use OVN as a control plane to manage logically
# direct connectivity to networks that are locally accessible to each chassis.
#
# This example includes two hypervisors.  Both hypervisors have two ports on them.
# We want to use OVN to manage the connectivity of these ports to a network
# attached to each hypervisor that we will call “physnet1”.
#
# This scenario requires some additional configuration of `ovn-controller`.  We
# must configure a mapping between `physnet1` and a local OVS bridge that provides
# connectivity to that network.  We call these “bridge mappings”.
